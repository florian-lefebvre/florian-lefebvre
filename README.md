# ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

I'm a French self-taught fullstack developer. I enjoy designing and creating beautiful, functional websites as well as mobile apps. I've been coding for more than 2 years now.

I've been working on [op-ent](https://github.com/op-ent) lately, a French open-source school management system.

Feel free to contact me and give stars if you like what I do!
