# ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

I'm a French self-taught fullstack developer. I enjoy designing and creating beautiful, functional websites as well as mobile apps. I've been coding for more than 2 years now.

I've been working on [yNotes](https://ynotes.fr) lately, a school life mobile application that connects French students to their school services.

Feel free to contact me and give stars if you like what I do!
