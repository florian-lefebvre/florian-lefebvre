## Hi 👋 I'm Florian

I'm a fullstack web developer working as a freelancer, remotely from France. I'm also an [Astro](https://astro.build/) [core maintainer](https://github.com/withastro/.github/blob/main/MEMBERS.md).

You can find me pretty much anywhere, but I prefer to be contacted by email. See [my website](https://florian-lefebvre.dev/) for more info.

I'm currently working on the Astro framework, Astro websites and community Astro integrations.
