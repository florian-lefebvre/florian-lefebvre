# ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

I am a French student who likes to program on his free time since 2018, when I discovered programming with Unreal Engine 4. In December 2019, I started web development and since then, I can't stop: Tailwind CSS, Vue.js, Supabase, Flutter... I have already done several projects but I still have a lot to learn.

I'm currently working hard on ![yNotes]("https://ynotes.fr"), a school life mobile application using Flutter & Dart that connects to French school services. 

Feel free to contact me and give stars if you like what I do!
