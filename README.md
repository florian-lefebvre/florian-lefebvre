## Hi all! 👋

- 🔭 I'm a French web fullstack developer working as a freelancer. I love Open-Source: I've been an [Astro](https://github.com/withastro) maintainer since December 2023 and core maintainer since June 2024
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **TRPC, Drizzle and Astro core internals**
- 👨‍💻 I deeply enjoy working with Astro, Typescript and Tailwind CSS to craft quality websites and interfaces.
- 👉 You can find out more info and other social links [on my website](https://florian-lefebvre.dev).
